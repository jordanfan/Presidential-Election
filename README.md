# Presidential-Election
This project explored presidential election outcomes from 2004 to 2016 on a county level and implemented a Classification model and KNN in R to predict the outcomes of the 2016 election outcomes. 

# Summary 
Included is my group's code and report of our results. Here is the breakdown of the report:
  1. Data wrangling and cleaning of election results from 2004-2016 and census data. 
  2. Exploration of Democratic and Republican counties based on economic and social factors such as education levels, race, and labor force percentage 
  3. Code that generates a map that shows the distribution of voters in counties. 
  4. Classification Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor implementations with 88.5% accuracy and 85.4% accuracy respectively
